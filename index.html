		<p class="lead font-weight-bolder">
			
			<strong>
			
			Accomplishments that I have achieved over the years have been a result of hard work and continuous efforts. I have also believed that doing hard work continuously will never go waste and therefor I am constantly motivated to work harder and grasp as many as new things possible; which has resulted in a few of my accomplishments. 
				
				<br><br>
				
				While working at Tech Mahindra, my diligent attitude towards work led me towards earning the “Pat on the Back” award along with a “Bravo” award for three consecutive quarters. The receiving of these awards persuaded me to put more focus in the work, keep learning and excelling in my career. Due to my competence in management skills and work towards upgrading and achieving higher, Tech Mahindra also awarded me with the “Associate Consistent Excellence” award for documenting, redesigning and improving business process. Working in Conestoga College as an International Student Outreach Ambassador is also a kind of accomplishment for me. 
				
				<br><br>
				
				This is because I would be meeting new people every day, trying my best to help them transition smoothly in Canada. I have also managed the registration of the new students successfully which is an accomplishment by itself as it gives me satisfaction to know that my skills and ability to help this student is making their transition easier. My career path has not been smooth and easy always, but instead is a result of, lot of arduous tasks and efforts which has eventually led me to go up my career path which is an accomplishment in its own way.

          <p class="lead font-weight-bold" style="text-align: left">
          As mentioned earlier, I am an extrovert person and that is one of my skills that I would be beneficial for the organization to tap into. Apart from this I have always believed in group work. As I would be working with the different types of groups while working with the organization, my extrovert trait will help me getting along with people easily as well as working with cooperation too.
			  
			  <br><br>
			  I have always been a goal-oriented person, which means that all my efforts would be dedicated towards achieving the organization’s goal. My past work experience shows my ability to work under pressure in different roles without losing focus on work delegated to me. Being a curious person, I always have the eagerness to learn, understand and grasp new things. This will be advantageous to the organization as they can utilize this quality of mine towards growth of the organization. 
			  
			  <br><br>
			  At the same time being a very patient person is something that has always helped me to not panic during organizational crisis or while taking important decisions. The ability of multi-tasking that I have acquired throughout my work experience has enabled me to handle two aspects i.e. being part of different projects at the same time, working with groups alongside doing the individuals task assigned to me will therefore in favor of the organization. Furthermore, passion towards helping others and trying to maintain a harmonious environment which is something an organization demands is something I have always been connected to and would be a productive source for the organization to utilize.
